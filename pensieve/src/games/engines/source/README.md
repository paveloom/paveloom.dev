# Source

Source is a 3D game engine developed by Valve. It debuted as the successor to GoldSrc with Half-Life: Source in June 2004, followed by Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life 2 later that year. Source does not have a concise version numbering scheme; instead, it is designed in constant incremental updates. The engine was succeeded by Source 2.

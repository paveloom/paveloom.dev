Created a [pull request](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/258646) to add [VTFEdit](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VTFEdit) to [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs). That's a rather old Windows application (circa 2005--2011), but it's rather important for people who'd like to have high quality sprays in [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source) games. So, I used [Wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)) and [`winetricks`](https://github.com/Winetricks/winetricks) to make it work!

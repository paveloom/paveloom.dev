# June 2023

### Friday, 9 {#9}

#### Meson

Home at last. Reading into [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com).

### Tuesday, 6 {#6}

#### [PMG](../../git.md#pmg) {#6#pmg}

Defended my diploma today and received an "excellent" rating! This work is finally finished.

Dobby is free!

### Monday, 5 {#5}

#### [PMG](../../git.md#pmg) {#5#pmg}

We gathered with groupmates today to discuss the presentations. Applied some stylistic changes as a result.

### Sunday, 4 {#4}

#### [PMG](../../git.md#pmg) {#4#pmg}

Aight, done did it: compressed the presentation under 10 minutes.

My legs hurt from walking in circles so much (pretty much the whole day on feet).

### Saturday, 3 {#3}

#### [PMG](../../git.md#pmg) {#3#pmg}

Committed the code of the presentation, rehearsed and reduced the text more (turns out there's really not that much you can fit under 10 minutes). I might reduce it even more, will do some more timing tomorrow.

### Friday, 2 {#2}

#### [PMG](../../git.md#pmg) {#2#pmg}

Spent most of the day just walking outside in circles, preparing the speech for the presentation. It's kinda chilly out there.

### Thursday, 1 {#1}

#### [PMG](../../git.md#pmg) {#1#pmg}

Worked on the presentation a bit more.

#### Private torrent trackers

Yesterday RARGB was [discontinued](https://web.archive.org/web/20230531105653/https://rarbg.to/index80.php). That's rather sad since it was one of the best *public* torrent trackers out there. [TorrentLeech](https://www.torrentleech.org), one of the popular *private* trackers, [gives away invites](https://reddit.com/r/OpenSignups/comments/13wwg7w/torrentleech_tl_opens_signups_invite_code) on the occasion, and today I got one. This is my first private tracker (and I've been torrenting for more than 10 years), so I learned about ratios, hit-and-runs, and more.

Here's my opinion so far: it doesn't make any sense to download releases that are not marked as `FREELEECH` (releases that don't count into the downloading count, meaning they don't affect the ratio, which is the division of uploaded to downloaded), since the pool of people is much smaller than on public trackers, and everyone downloading is obliged to be seeding, too. I can't really compete with people using seedboxes. Since `FREELEECH` releases are always seeded, you can get high-quality content (which is what is usually marked with this tag) quite easily.

TL Points are a joke, though, not gonna lie. I counted that it will take me about a year (without bonuses) of seeding to repay for the 3 GB I've downloaded today.

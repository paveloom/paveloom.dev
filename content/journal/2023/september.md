### Saturday, 2 {#2}

#### C {#2#c}

Watched some of the [VoxelRifts](https://www.youtube.com/@voxelrifts)' videos. Finally, some C positivity and DIY mentality!

#### Maintenance {#2#maintenance}

Created a [pull request](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/252981) to update [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) in [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs). The latest version has a fix for crashes caused by copying the contents of fields in the Browser. That said, they have the most horrendous build process I've ever seen.

#### Japanese {#1#japanese}

Was learning how to use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) today. Already got into thinking about whether to use subdecks, tags, or fields for organization. I got a [deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1602436756) for [GENKI I](https://genki3.japantimes.co.jp/en), but will have to remake it.

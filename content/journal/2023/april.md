#### Codon

Created a [pull request](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/224257) to add [Codon](https://docs.exaloop.io/codon) to Nixpkgs.

This took two days. The worst part was to bypass issues with [CMake](https://cmake.org) and [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake). Also, I ended up compiling a [fork](https://github.com/exaloop/llvm-project) of [LLVM](https://llvm.org), which wasn't as bad as I thought. It doesn't take much RAM and disk space if you compile it with [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) in the Release mode and link it with [`ldd`](https://lld.llvm.org). Takes about half an hour on my laptop.

#### Gut

Created a [pull request](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/224267) to add [Gut](https://gut-cli.dev) to Nixpkgs.

It takes a couple of minutes to package a pure Go module.

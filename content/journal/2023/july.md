# July 2023

### Saturday, 15 {#15}

#### [Groovy](../../git.md#groovy) {#15#groovy}

Read more of the [GLib reference](https://docs.gtk.org/glib). By the way, the reference is better structured if you use [Devhelp](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Devhelp) to access it.

#### Objectivism {#15#objectivism}

Started reading [Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism:_The_Philosophy_of_Ayn_Rand).

### Friday, 14 {#14}

#### Life {#14#life}

Registered an application to the military commissariat today, so that they proceed with me according to the law. This is hopefully the last interaction with them this month, so I've finally finished with all these worries and now have some time for myself.

### Thursday, 13 {#13}

#### Life {#13#life}

Somewhat upset after the visit to the military commissariat today. The draft board there is seemingly unenthusiastic about me going against the system, although some draft department workers are genuinely trying to help. I might encounter unpleasant surprises in the fall.

### Wednesday, 12 {#12}

#### Life {#12#life}

Visited my local military commissariat today, taught some ol' fellas about alternative civilian service. Will be visiting them again tomorrow. Did some related paper work.

Changed the router at home to the one I was using in the dormitory while studying at the university. Turns out one antenna gives better coverage and more stable signal than three antennas (same [dBm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel#Radio_power,_energy,_and_field_strength) and [dBi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel#Antenna_measurements)). Not sure why, though.

### Tuesday, 11 {#11}

#### Nixpkgs

Answered to the reviews of the pull requests for [Zigmod](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/217229) and [GR Framework](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/238469).

Also, created a PR to update [`libremidi`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/242909). First time using [`nipkgs-review`](https://github.com/Mic92/nixpkgs-review) in a while!

#### Site

Made it so that the `repo_url` configuration option is set based on the hosting.

### Saturday, 8 {#8}

#### [Groovy](../../git.md#groovy) {#8#groovy}

We had a pretty rough thunderstorm today, had no electricity for quite some time and still don't have internet (this update will be pushed much later than committed). I was able to finish watching the [Creating a GObject in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-_EBEr0fxI) video by [Christian Hergert](http://hergert.me) before lights went out. Did some small stylistic changes in the code after that. Then, I read some of the [GLib documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/glib).

I will be on a short business trip for the next couple of days.

### Friday, 7 {#7}

#### [Groovy](../../git.md#groovy) {#7#groovy}

Finished with the [GObject documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject). Tested this new knowledge by rewriting the current code using subclassing.

### Thursday, 6 {#6}

#### [Groovy](../../git.md#groovy) {#6#groovy}

Read more of the [GObject documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject).

### Wednesday, 5 {#5}

#### MAP {#5#map}

Read some more [MAP](../../pensieve/minor-attracted-person.md) related materials.

### Tuesday, 4 {#4}

#### MAP {#4#map}

Did some more study on [MAP](../../pensieve/minor-attracted-person.md) related topics.

### Monday, 3 {#3}

#### MAP {#3#map}

Was reading about [minor-related chronophilias](../../pensieve/minor-attracted-person.md) the whole day. This is apparently actually tabooed knowledge (it's even censored on Wikipedia, and bigoted by almost everyone on any platform).

### Sunday, 2 {#2}

#### [Groovy](../../git.md#groovy) {#2#groovy}

Have been reading the [GObject documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject), and the library is actually pretty neat. But also somewhat convoluted. Insert the obligatory "we have [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) at home" meme here.

### Saturday, 1 {#1}

#### [Groovy](../../git.md#groovy) {#1#groovy}

Finished reading the additional documentation in the [GTK documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4). [GObject documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject) is next, since having a grasp of the type system is essential.

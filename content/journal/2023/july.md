# July 2023

### Tuesday, 4 {#4}

#### MAP {#4#map}

Did some more study on [MAP](../../pensieve/minor-attracted-person.md) related topics.

### Monday, 3 {#3}

#### MAP {#3#map}

Was reading about [minor-related chronophilias](../../pensieve/minor-attracted-person.md) the whole day. This is apparently actually tabooed knowledge (it's even censored on Wikipedia, and bigoted by almost everyone on any platform).

### Sunday, 2 {#2}

#### [Groovy](../../git.md#groovy) {#2#groovy}

Have been reading the [GObject documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject), and the library is actually pretty neat. But also somewhat convoluted. Insert the obligatory "we have [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) at home" meme here.

### Saturday, 1 {#1}

#### [Groovy](../../git.md#groovy) {#1#groovy}

Finished reading the additional documentation in the [GTK documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4). [GObject documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject) is next, since having a grasp of the type system is essential.

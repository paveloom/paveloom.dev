### Tuesday, 11 {#11}

#### Nixpkgs

Answered to the reviews of the pull requests for [Zigmod](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/217229) and [GR Framework](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/238469).

Also, created a PR to update [`libremidi`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/242909). First time using [`nipkgs-review`](https://github.com/Mic92/nixpkgs-review) in a while!

#### Site

Made it so that the `repo_url` configuration option is set based on the hosting.

### Saturday, 8 {#8}

#### [Groovy](../../git.md#groovy) {#8#groovy}

We had a pretty rough thunderstorm today, had no electricity for quite some time and still don't have internet (this update will be pushed much later than committed). I was able to finish watching the [Creating a GObject in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-_EBEr0fxI) video by [Christian Hergert](http://hergert.me) before lights went out. Did some small stylistic changes in the code after that. Then, I read some of the [GLib documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/glib).

I will be on a short business trip for the next couple of days.

### Friday, 7 {#7}

#### [Groovy](../../git.md#groovy) {#7#groovy}

Finished with the [GObject documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject). Tested this new knowledge by rewriting the current code using subclassing.

### Thursday, 6 {#6}

#### [Groovy](../../git.md#groovy) {#6#groovy}

Read more of the [GObject documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject).

### Wednesday, 5 {#5}

#### MAP {#5#map}

Read some more [MAP](../../pensieve/minor-attracted-person.md) related materials.

### Tuesday, 4 {#4}

#### MAP {#4#map}

Did some more study on [MAP](../../pensieve/minor-attracted-person.md) related topics.

### Monday, 3 {#3}

#### MAP {#3#map}

Was reading about [minor-related chronophilias](../../pensieve/minor-attracted-person.md) the whole day. This is apparently actually tabooed knowledge (it's even censored on Wikipedia, and bigoted by almost everyone on any platform).

### Sunday, 2 {#2}

#### [Groovy](../../git.md#groovy) {#2#groovy}

Have been reading the [GObject documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject), and the library is actually pretty neat. But also somewhat convoluted. Insert the obligatory "we have [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) at home" meme here.

### Saturday, 1 {#1}

#### [Groovy](../../git.md#groovy) {#1#groovy}

Finished reading the additional documentation in the [GTK documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4). [GObject documentation](https://docs.gtk.org/gobject) is next, since having a grasp of the type system is essential.

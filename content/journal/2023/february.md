#### NixOS {#1#nixos}

Aight, [there is much configuration to do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2IqlyS0CJk&t=2294s). I've installed NixOS on the disk since I couldn't build [QuiteRSS](https://quiterss.org) from source in a virtual machine. Ironically, I couldn't do that on a real machine either. Gonna look out for a replacement ([NewsFlash](https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news_flash_gtk), most likely).

On a related note, I have an unfinished project for my own RSS reader called [Tidings](../../git.md#tidings).

#### Plex

You can start a [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) server in a container with

```bash
sudo podman run \
  -d \
  --name plex \
  --network=host \
  -e TZ="<timezone>" \
  -v /path/to/database:/config:Z \
  -v /path/to/transcode:/transcode:Z \
  -v /path/to/data:/data:Z \
  docker.io/plexinc/pms-docker
```

The Web interface is at [`http://localhost:32400/web`](http://localhost:32400/web). Make sure the directories have sufficient privileges. See more info about the image [here](https://github.com/plexinc/pms-docker).

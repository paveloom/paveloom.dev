Ebuild sub-slots can be used to specify versions of the package that cannot be installed simultaneously (compared to regular slots that allow that). For example, the [`media-libs/libsfml`](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/media-libs/libsfml) package has subslots `0/2.6` and `0/3.0`.

See [Devmanual > Slotting > Sub-slots](https://devmanual.gentoo.org/general-concepts/slotting/#sub-slots).

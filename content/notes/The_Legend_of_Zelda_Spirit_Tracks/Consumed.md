### Review

The ending was pretty good! The touch screen only interactions are rather
unique, but... they are also quite inconvenient, and higlhy pixelated models
with no antialiasing are... eh. Moving on the train from place to place is
getting old after a bit of time. Still, a pretty OK entry in the franchise.

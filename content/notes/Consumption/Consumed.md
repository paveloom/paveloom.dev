### Review

The game is amazing. The visuals are great, the plot is decent-ish (there are
some plot holes with timey-wimey stuff). My only gripe is the controls... I did
play on Dolphin emulator, so that's an an issue to expect, and yet, it seems
like the game itself really has terrible controls (Wii Remote needs
recalibrating pretty much every time it is used in the game).

### Review

The ending was pretty good! The touch screen only interactions are rather
unique, but... they are also quite inconvenient, and higlhy pixelated models
with no antialiasing are... eh. Moving on the train from place to place is
getting old after a bit of time. Still, a pretty OK entry in the franchise.

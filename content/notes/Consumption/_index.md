I have a list of pieces of media in different categories that I plan on consuming. I go through each item in a given category in order they appear in the list, and then, when I am satisfied with the volume of consumed media, I switch to the next category, also in order. An example of when this happens is when a franchise is conquered (e.g., all media related to *The Legend of Zelda*). I spend up to two hours a day on this planned consumption, to upkeep my sanity and broaden my horizons.

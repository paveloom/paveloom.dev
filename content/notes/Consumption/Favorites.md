My main factor for including something into the list of favorites is the level of willingness for repeated consumption. This can be called re-playability, re-watchability, re-readability, etc., as appropriate.

See also [Great titles](@/notes/Consumption/Great_titles.md) for a more general list of great media consumed.

See also the [parent note](@/notes/Consumption/_index.md).

### Review

It's really just Scrum, with team roles removed, with some of the artifacts removed (no charts), with estimated difficulties removed (no story points or explicit effort estimates), with subjective measures of tracking progress tacked on, with quarterly and yearly reviews added, with some of the terms renamed. Overall, it's fine, and somewhat close to what I have already been doing. Bonus points for complementary practices mentioned, those are helpful to have alongside the planning system.

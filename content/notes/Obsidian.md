## Tips

### UI

My preferred layout is the main area on the left, local graph view in the top half of the right sidebar, outline of the file in the bottom half of the right sidebar. To open the local graph view, press the three dots on a note > Open Linked view > Open local graph. This will open the graph in a linked tab. Drag and drop this tab to the right sidebar. Then, drag and drop all of the other tabs in the sidebar to the lower half of it, thus creating a vertical split.

### WikiLinks

Obsidian uses WikiLinks (words surrounded with double square braces) for the representation of internal links in the text format. Regular Markdown links can be used instead (singular square brackets that link to a file in the current vault).

To make the switch,

1. Open Settings.
2. Under Files & Links, disable Use Wikilink.

See [Obsidian Help: Internal links](https://help.obsidian.md/links).

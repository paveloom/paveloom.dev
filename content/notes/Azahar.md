## Gotchas

- To save any settings (including application directories), go to Emulation > Configure and press OK
- To make games in the application directories visible to the emulator, make sure the games are decrypted and stored with the extension `.cci` (instead of `.3ds`)
- To go fullscreen on GNOME, it might be necessary to focus the game window twice (once through Alt-Tab select, then again by pressing Super twice, then F4 to unpause).

## General settings

Check View > Fullscreen to start applications in fullscreen.

Uncheck View > Single Window Mode to start applications in separate windows.

Access the general settings by selecting Emulation > Configure.

### General

- [x] Confirm exit while emulation is running
- [x] Pause emulation when in background
- [ ] Mute audio when in background
- [x] Hide mouse on inactivity
- [x] Enable Gamemode

Remember to unpause the application (F4 by default) when focusing it again.

### Controls

The following are settings accessed by going to Emulation > Configure > Controls in the main menu.

#### Hotkeys

Clear the F5 and F6 hotkeys for stopping and restarting emulation, respectively (they don't ask for confirmation).

## Games

The following are the games that I have run using this emulator:

- [The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds](@/notes/The_Legend_of_Zelda_A_Link_Between_Worlds/_index.md)
- [The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes](@/notes/The_Legend_of_Zelda_Tri_Force_Heroes/_index.md)

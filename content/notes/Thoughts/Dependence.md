title = "Dependence"
+++

I am convinced that, in our life, we are very much dependent on others. Perhaps, the social dependence *can* be controlled via properly set boundaries, but the material dependence is practically unavoidable. It's hard to imagine human existence without manufacturing, and that doesn't scale without the involvement of other people. The dependence on knowledge of others is also essential. When shared, it allows me to expand my skill set and solve new kinds of problems. In fact, I wouldn't be able to do what I do now without the products of labor and knowledge provided by others.

This works the other way around, as well. It is my observation that whatever I do seems to be meaningful *only if* it makes some kind of influence outside of myself. In a way, when the result of work done lies beyond me, and especially if I can project that it will last beyond my lifetime.

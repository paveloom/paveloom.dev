title = "Practice over theory"

It is my observation that knowledge, as skills, is only really acquired through practice, and almost never through plain theory. The practice should have application in the real world, otherwise the gained knowledge will fade over time. Evidence of this can be found in the very early stages of life, specifically in education. School subjects are forgotten right after graduation. University lectures are forgotten after each course is over. Non-fiction books and textbooks are forgotten after they are read. All of that seems to be true *if* there wasn't any accompanying practice.

### Review

The game is amazing. The visuals are great, the plot is decent-ish (there are
some plot holes with the timey-wimey stuff). My only gripe is the... controls. I
did play on Dolphin emulator, so that's an an issue to expect, and yet, it seems
like the game itself really has terrible controls (Wii Remote needs
recalibrating pretty much every time it is used in the game).

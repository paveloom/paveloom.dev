The keybinds configuration should allow for the following actions in-game:

- Slash Vertically: 'Click 1'
- Slash eastward: 'Q' + 'Click 1'

- Slash northeastward: 'Z'

To recalibrate the view plane, place the cursor in a spot on the screen where the center of the *current* view plane is (or as near as possible), then press Down Arrow. Repeat if necessary.

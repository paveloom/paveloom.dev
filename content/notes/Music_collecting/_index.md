title = "Music collecting"

While streaming services (e.g., Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) are popular, they don't provide real ownership of the music releases. Rather, you are renting the music, paying either via money or attention. Any release can get removed from such services at any time for whatever reason, and you might not even notice it. The following notes focus on the use case of having a local collection of music files.

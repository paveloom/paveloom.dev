# Media players

Media player software is a type of application software for playing multimedia computer files like audio and video files. Media players commonly display standard media control icons known from physical devices such as tape recorders and CD players, such as play (&nbsp;▶️&nbsp;), pause (&nbsp;⏸&nbsp;), fastforward (&nbsp;⏩️&nbsp;), backforward (&nbsp;⏪&nbsp;), and stop (&nbsp;⏹️&nbsp;) buttons. In addition, they generally have progress bars (or "playback bars"), which are sliders to locate the current position in the duration of the media file.

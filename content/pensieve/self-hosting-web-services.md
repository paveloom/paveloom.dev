# Self-hosting (web services)

Self-hosting is the practice of running and maintaining a website or service using a private web server, instead of using a service outside of someone's own control. For example, someone wishing to write a blog could use hosted blog services. Alternatively, they could install content management system software on their own server to self-host their blog.

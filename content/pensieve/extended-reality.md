# Extended reality

Extended reality (XR) is a catch-all term to refer to augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality or mediated reality (MR), letting "X" be an arbitrary variable that can interpolate between these various realities or eXtrapolate (eXtend) beyond them. The technology is intended to combine or mirror the physical world with a "digital twin world" able to interact with it.

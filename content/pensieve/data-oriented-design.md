# Data-oriented design

As a design paradigm, data-oriented-design focuses on optimal transformations of data and focuses on modelling programs as transforms. Transforms are abstractions of code that solely focus on the mapping of inputs to outputs. They do not distinguish between accessing inputs by parameter, pointer, reference, upvalue, and vice versa with writing outputs. This eliminates the concept of a Side-effect and focuses solely on how inputs transform into outputs, logically identical to functions in mathematics.

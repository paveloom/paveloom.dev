### Keyboard shortcuts

There are two modes:

[`global`](#mode:global){ #mode:global }

:   This mode is active when _search is not focussed_ and when there's no other
    focussed element that is susceptible to keyboard input. The following keys
    are bound:

    * ++f++ , ++s++ , ++slash++ : open search dialog
    * ++p++ , ++comma++, ++arrow-left++ : go to previous page
    * ++n++ , ++period++, ++arrow-right++ : go to next page

[`search`](#mode:search){ #mode:search }

:   This mode is active when the _search is focused_. It provides several key
    bindings to make search accessible and navigable via keyboard:

    * ++arrow-down++ , ++arrow-up++ : select next / previous result
    * ++esc++ , ++tab++ : close search dialog
    * ++enter++ : follow selected result

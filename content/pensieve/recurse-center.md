# Recurse Center

The Recurse Center (formerly known as Hacker School; also called RC) is an independent educational institution, that, until the COVID-19 pandemic, combined a retreat for computer programmers with a recruiting agency. The retreat is an intentional community, a self-directed academic environment for programmers of all levels to improve their skills in, without charge. There is no curriculum and no particular programming languages or paradigms are institutionally favored; instead, participants work on open-source projects of their own choice, alone or collaboratively, as they see best. The Center has been an active advocate for women in programming. Since 2020 all programs have been conducted online.

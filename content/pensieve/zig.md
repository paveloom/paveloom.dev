# Zig

Zig is an imperative, general-purpose, statically typed, compiled system programming language designed by Andrew Kelley. The language is designed for "robustness, optimality and maintainability", supporting compile-time generics, reflection and evaluation, cross-compilation and manual memory management. A major goal of the language is to improve upon the C language, while also taking inspiration from Rust, among others. Zig has many features for low-level programming, notably packed structs (structs without padding between fields), arbitrary width integers and multiple pointer types.

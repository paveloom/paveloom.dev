# Command prompt

A command prompt (or just prompt) is a sequence of (one or more) characters used in a command-line interface to indicate readiness to accept commands. It literally prompts the user to take action. A prompt usually ends with one of the characters `$`, `%`, `#`, `:`, `>` or `-` and often includes other information, such as the path of the current working directory and the hostname.

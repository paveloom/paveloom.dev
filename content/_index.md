[Hello there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLWRDgItv-E)!

My name is Pavel Sobolev (he/him), also known as `paveloom` (`pave`, like Dave, then `loom`, like Doom). Although I'm comfortable with being called Pave since it is pretty common to shorten nicknames to the first few comfortably sounding syllables in high-paced video games, and I got somewhat accustomed to that in my youth. That's just easier to pronounce, anyway.

I am a self-taught [software engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) and an aspiring [software craftsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship). I was first introduced to programming when I learned [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) in my first year of university. While I didn't have a strong interest in it at first, the more code I wrote, the more I came to appreciate the [power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z67SeB4i_0) of programming and how one can solve problems and create new things with it. As I gained more experience, I started to explore topics beyond the curriculum (I was an astronomer student at the time) and eventually became an open sourcerer, which means that I contribute to [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) projects and make my work available for others to use and build upon. I have since learned a number of other programming languages, including [Julia](https://julialang.org), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), [Zig](https://ziglang.org), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Go](https://golang.org), in that order. These are not necessarily replacements for each other, but rather, extensions of the overall experience, which goes far beyond the language of choice.

I am always striving to learn new things and improve my skills. Hopefully, this website is a tastement to that. I try to add whatever practical information I acquire in my life to this personal collection of notes in the hopes of aiding my poor memory and, in the process, preserving the knowledge for generations to come.

# ~/paveloom

[Hello there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEq1Z0bjdwc)!

My name is Pavel Sobolev, also known as `paveloom` (`pave`, like `dave`, then `loom`), although I'm comfortable with being called Pave, since shortening nicknames to the first few comfortably sounding syllables is rather common in high-paced video games, and I got somewhat accustomed to that in my youth. That's just easier to pronounce anyway.

I am a self-taught [software engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) with great interest in [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science). I was first introduced to programming when I learned [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) in my first year of university. While I didn't have a strong interest in it at the time, the more code I wrote, the more I came to appreciate the [power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg14jNbBb-8) of programming and the ways it can be used to solve problems and create new things. As I gained more experience, I started to explore topics beyond the curriculum (I was an astronomer student at the time) and eventually became an open sourcerer, which means that I contribute to [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) projects and make my work available for others to use and build upon. I have since learned a number of other programming languages, including [Julia](https://julialang.org), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), and most recently [Zig](https://ziglang.org). These are not necessarily replacements for each other, but rather extensions of the overall experience, which goes beyond just the language of choice.

I am always striving to learn new things and improve my skills. You can see the notes that I have recorded in my personal digital garden, [Pensieve](/pensieve), and my work is available for others to see in the [Git](/git) section.

# About

[Hello there](https://odysee.com/@paveloom:e/Hello-there:cf)!

My name is Pavel Sobolev (he/him), also known as `paveloom` (`pave`, like `dave`, then `loom`, like `doom`). Although I'm comfortable with being called Pave since it is pretty common to shorten nicknames to the first few comfortably sounding syllables in high-paced video games, and I got somewhat accustomed to that in my youth. That's just easier to pronounce, anyway.

I am a self-taught [software engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) who is currently busy developing desktop [application software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software). I was first introduced to programming when I learned [Fortran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran) in my first year of university. While I didn't have a strong interest in it at first, the more code I wrote, the more I came to appreciate the [power](https://odysee.com/@paveloom:e/Unlimited-Power:b) of programming and how one can solve problems and create new things with it. As I gained more experience, I started to explore topics beyond the curriculum (I was an astronomer student at the time) and eventually became an open sourcerer, which means that I contribute to [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) projects and make my work available for others to use and build upon. I have since learned a number of other programming languages, including [Julia](https://julialang.org), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), [Zig](https://ziglang.org), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), in that order. These are not necessarily replacements for each other but are extensions of the overall experience, which goes far beyond the language of choice.

I am always striving to learn new things and improve my skills. You can check out the notes I have recorded in my digital garden, [Pensieve](pensieve/README.md), and my work is available for others to see in the [Git](git.md) section. I keep a journal for logging my life and work, and I think you might find something useful in there, it's in the [Journal](journal/README.md) section. Finally, I wrote a handful of blog entries back in the day, you can read those in the [Blog](blog/index.md) section.

#### Site navigation

Several shortcuts are available for the desktop users. There are two modes:

[`global`](#mode:global){ #mode:global }

:   This mode is active when _search is not focussed_ and when there's no other
    focussed element that is susceptible to keyboard input. The following keys
    are bound:

    * ++f++ , ++s++ , ++slash++ : open search dialog
    * ++p++ , ++comma++, ++arrow-left++ : go to previous page
    * ++n++ , ++period++, ++arrow-right++ : go to next page

[`search`](#mode:search){ #mode:search }

:   This mode is active when the _search is focused_. It provides several key
    bindings to make search accessible and navigable via keyboard:

    * ++arrow-down++ , ++arrow-up++ : select next / previous result
    * ++esc++ , ++tab++ : close search dialog
    * ++enter++ : follow selected result

You might also want to take a look at [how to use the search](https://lunrjs.com/guides/searching.html).
